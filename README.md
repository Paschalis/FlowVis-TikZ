# FlowVis-TikZ

An illustrative LaTeX project utilizing TikZ for creating and explaining a 3D PIV/RTV measurement process flowchart, showcasing complex technical procedures in a visually accessible format.

## Overview

This repository contains a LaTeX project designed to demonstrate the process of 3D Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) or Real-Time Visualization (RTV) measurement using a detailed flowchart. The project leverages the TikZ package within LaTeX to create an informative and visually engaging diagram that outlines each step of the PIV/RTV measurement process, making complex fluid dynamics research techniques understandable.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Proficiency in LaTeX for high-quality typesetting.
- Expertise in using the TikZ package to design complex diagrams.
- Ability to conceptualize and visualize technical processes through diagrammatic representation.
- Effective communication of intricate technical procedures in a clear and concise manner.

## Project Description

This project showcases a flowchart diagram created in LaTeX with the TikZ package, detailing the steps involved in conducting 3D Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) or Real-Time Visualization (RTV) measurements. From setting up the experiment, calibrating equipment, capturing and analyzing particle images, to reconstructing the 3D positions and velocities of particles within a fluid, this flowchart serves as a visual guide to understand the methodologies behind fluid dynamics research. The aim is to demystify the technical process, making it accessible to a broader audience.
